# Mini Project 1: Data Visualization and Wrangling

## Due date

This mini project is due on GitHub by Wednesday, May 01 at midnight.

## Description

You will work with a partner to analyze Coronavirus data contained in the [`coronavirus` R package](https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus/index.html) and to write a short blog summarizing your findings. You will need to define your own question(s) of interest based on your interests---the topic is up to you. Please incorporate both coronavirus infection and vaccination information in your analysis. The best projects will:

- discuss an interesting and well-motivated topic
- involve some non-trivial data wrangling (not just a bunch of `mutate()`s)
- provide a well thought-out, informative analysis
- convey some sort of insight
- be well-written
- consist of 500â€“700 words

Your goal is to use the data wrangling and visualization techniques from this class to tell an interesting story about any aspect of coronavirus disease in a particular geographical entity (or the whole world, your choice!). Write your analysis in the form of blog post in R Markdown and use the data visualization and wrangling tools you learned in this course. 

Please include at least one well-crafted, thoughtfully-prepared data graphic incorporating maps that conveys useful information. Please include at least one well-crafted, thoughtfully prepared data graphic that incorporates maps and conveys useful information. A good project would feature one map visualization and one time trend plot, among others. Feel free to use `ggplot2` graphics and other libraries used in the course to help tell your story. You will upload your R Markdown (.Rmd) file and knitted PDF to GitHub. Do not forget to give your post an informative title! 

Do not print your code in your PDF, rather make sure to hide it from the knitted document, but know that I will open your .Rmd to grade your code --- so be sure to be organized and make good use of comments!

## Data

The data for this project come from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus, and are updated everyday. These data are available in the `coronavirus` R package as `coronavirus` and `covid19_vaccine` datasets. Be sure to read the [package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/coronavirus/index.html), [data source](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/) and check the [author's GitHub page](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) for useful directions!! **It is your responsibility to know what data you are working with!**

To get a list of the available data sets, run the following code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RamiKrispin/coronavirus")
library(coronavirus)
?coronavirus
```



## Grading Rubric


**Technical aspects**

| Topic                                          | Excellent: 10 | Good: 7.5 | Satisfactory: 5 | Needs work: 2.5 |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Coding style | Group has gone beyond what was expected and required, coding style is followed, code is well commented | Group mostly follows coding style, code is readable and has some comments, but with some inconsistencies | Coding style lacks refinement and has some errors, but code is readable and has some comments | Many errors in coding style, little attention paid to making the code human readable |
| Coding strategy | Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array). Code checks for common errors | Code is mostly efficient, correct, and minimal, with occasional deviations. Uses appropriate data structures and checks for some errors | Code is correct, but could be edited down to leaner code. Some "hacking" instead of using suitable data structure. Some checks for errors. | Code tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be functionalized. No anticipation of errors. |
| Presentation: graphs | Graph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose. Careful styling highlights important features, and attention is paid to labels, colors, and scales. | Graph(s) well chosen and styled, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels, or sub optimal color choices. | Graph(s) well chosen, but with some issues: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels, or lack of attention to detail in styling. | Graph(s) poorly chosen to support questions, with little attention paid to styling, labels, or appropriate visualization type. |
| Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity | Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course. | Student displays a high level of mastery and creativity, but without extraordinary effort or additional tools | Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps, somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition. | Student does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope. |
| Ease of access, compliance with course conventions for submitted work | Access as easy as possible, code runs, .Rmd knits without error or extra messages, everything is on time | Code runs and .Rmd knits with minor issues, mostly complies with course conventions and is on time | Code runs, but .Rmd may have some issues knitting or generate extra messages; some deviations from course conventions, but overall acceptable; submitted work may be slightly late | Not an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions and/or code does not run |



**Data wrangling**

| Topic                                          | Excellent: 10 | Good: 7.5 | Satisfactory: 5 | Needs work: 2.5 |

| Joining data:<br>Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity | Group has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course. | Group has applied tools and techniques competently and creatively, but without extraordinary effort or additional tools. | Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps, somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition. | Group does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope. |
| Single table wrangling:<br>Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity | Group has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course. | Group has applied tools and techniques competently and creatively, but without extraordinary effort or additional tools. | Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps, somewhat creatively.

**Communication**

| Topic                 | Excellent: 10 | Good: 7.5 | Satisfactory: 5 | Needs work: 2.5 |
|-----------------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Data introduction | Clearly and concisely describes the data set, and why it is of interest. Establishes an engaging story (i.e., set of questions) that will be told. | Introduction and story are clear, but could be more engaging; provides context and motivation but lacks some detail. | Introduction and story outlined, but could be clearer or more engaging; context and motivation are present but may not be strong. | Context and motivation is lacking; story unclear or not well-defined. |
| Results | Results are clearly explained in an engaging way. The questions posed are clearly answered. Potential limitations are outlined and discussed. | Results are clear and engaging, but some minor improvements could be made; most questions are answered and some limitations are addressed. | Results are explained, and the questions posed are answered; limitations may be mentioned but not discussed in detail. | Results are not completely explained and/or questions are left unanswered; limitations are not addressed. |
| Code review           | Extensive evidence that group members are giving constructive feedback on each other's code, leading to better code. | Evidence that group members are giving feedback on each other's code, with some room for improvement. | Some evidence that group members are giving constructive feedback on each other's code, leading to better code. | Little evidence that group members are giving constructive feedback on each other's code. |
